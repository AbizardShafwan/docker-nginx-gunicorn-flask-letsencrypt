### Set-up & Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

#### 1) Define applications details
In `.env` file, enter your application details for the bellow variables.   
```
SSL_EMAIL=myemail@myemail.com
NGX_DOMAIN=mysuperwebsite.com
FLASK_SESSION_KEY=super_secret_key
```
*_SSL_EMAIL: Email address for Letsencrypt SSL certificate_   
*_NGX_DOMAIN: Domain name for Nginx config and Letsencrypt SSL certificate_   
*_FLASK_SESSION_KEY: Secret Key for Flask Session. It can be whatever you want. ie. 6d8dg8f4-49f493bf9-h30f489h9n_

#### 2) SSL Cert

We then need to install the Letsencrypt client to get SSL certicates.
```sh
$ make install-le-client
```
You will need to enter sudo password as the command needs to run with privileges.  
It installs the Letsencrypt client and get a certificate for specified domain and email address.   
Wait and follow the different instructions.

_Note: Free Letsencrypt cert are only available for 90 days. To renew the cert run_
```sh
$ make renew-le-cert
```

### Firing up ‚úÖ

**Start application**
```sh
$ sudo make dc-start
```
_Your web app should be now accessible at your domain with SSL certificates üéâ_

**Stop application**
```sh
$ sudo make dc-stop
```
