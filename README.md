<p align="center">Boilerplate code for setting up Nginx + Gunicorn + Flask + LetsEncrypt certificates using docker-compose.</p>

---

This repository contains necessary files to build a web-app running
with Nginx / Gunicorn / Flask / LetsEncrypt (Certbot) using Docker 
and docker-compose.  

**Note: Tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04**

## Docker

service | image
--- | ---
flask & gunicorn | `python:3.8.3-alpine3.11`
nginx | `nginx:1.18.0-alpine`

## Requirements

dependency | commands
--- | ---
docker | [commands for Debian / Ubuntu](https://gist.github.com/smallwat3r/a1664013e6ca8fb9ee02dd4b886a4996)
docker-compose | [commands for Debian / Ubuntu](https://gist.github.com/smallwat3r/05f4b4a7a8361901d23bfdd492e40870)
make | `sudo apt install make`
a domain or sub-domain | DNS A record needs to points to your server static IP

## Setting things up

#### 1) Clone this repo on your server

I recommend doing so under `/opt`  

```sh
cd /opt
sudo git clone https://github.com/smallwat3r/docker-nginx-gunicorn-flask-letsencrypt.git
```

Install docker, docker-compose and make (commands can be found
[above](#requirements)).  

#### 2) Add user to `docker` group  

```sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
Log out from the server and log back in for changes to apply.  

#### 3) Define your application details

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set up the environment variables.
```sh
# .env

# Email to get alerts from LetsEncrypt.
EMAIL=email@email.com

# Domain name or subdomain linked to your server's public IP.
DOMAIN=mydomain.com

# Folder where your flask app is located in the repo. In this example
# it's under ./src/
APP_FOLDER=src

# Application environment name
FLASK_ENV=development

# It can be the application entrypoint (wsgi if using ./src/wsgi.py)
# or the application package (as in this case) as the app's
# configs are under ./src/example_app/__init__.py
FLASK_APP=example_app
```

## Turning it on

**Start application**
```sh
sudo make dc-start
```
<p style="text-align: center;">
 ðŸŽ‰ Your web-app should now be running online with HTTPS ðŸŽ‰   
</p>

**Other commands**
```sh
sudo make dc-stop        # Stop application.
sudo make dc-start-local # Start application w/o nginx (for running locally)

make help                # List all the commands available from Makefile.
```

Auto checks are running weekly to update the certificates.
